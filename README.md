# Becoming AirBnB superhost: Is it worth it? 

__How becoming a superhost pays off on Airbnb: Whether superhosts charge higher than their non-accredited counterparts and whether they get better ratings?__

## Motivation

Peer-to-peer accommodation services such as Airbnb have become a game-changer in the rental market and the tourism accommodation sector. Literature has investigated a different price determinants of Airbnb listings such as: listing attributes, host attributes, rental policies, listing reputation, and listing location (see more at [More Resources](##more-resources))

This project addresses the following research questions: 
+ Do superhosts charge higher than non-superhosts for listings with same characteristics? 
+ Does superhosts' estimated monthly income differ from that of non-accredited hosts? 

Answering these questions benefits Airbnb users (i.e, hosts and guests) in different ways:
+ For Airbnb hosts: Becoming a superhost requires huge time and effort investments. The results from this study can help answer the question: Is it worth it to become a superhost? 
+ For Airbnb guests: This helps travelers understand the price listing bias which in turns helps them make better decision when comparing and choosing accomodations on Airbnb.  

## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## Repository overview

Provide an overview of the directory structure and files.

## Running instructions

Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. Touch upon, if necessary, the required input data, which (secret) credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow.
