Trang    : What factors affect Airbnb booking window? (View below the conceptual framework for detailed variables description)

![Conceptual Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silisav3/group-9-investigating-airbnb/main/Research%20Questions/conceptual_framework.png)

--- It's is essential for hosts to anticipate consumer behavior to make optimal decisions related to time-discrimination price settings & revenue management
--- Note: Assumption: Availability variables are based only on the booking status of the listing (not because the listing is blocked.)

Tolga    : Do superhosts (experienced hosts who provide a shining example for other hosts, and extraordinary experiences for their guests) have higher ratings than ordinary hosts? 

** Check variable 17 on listings data. Binary variable indicating whether the host is super or not. We can use this information as a "treatment" and see whether their ratings are higher. In addition, we can match superhosts in Amsterdam with non-super hosts in another city with similar characteristics. 

** Possible research method: Regression, Sample Matching

** Motivation: This question is actually important, because if super hosts do not have a relatively higher rating, then Airbnb shoud probably increase the acceptance criterias to become a superhost. If they are not rated high enough, then customers will lose their credibility for Airbnb.
